👨🏻‍💻 I recently obtained Honor Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications at the Posts and Telecommunications Instidute of Technologyy (PTIT) - Hanoi, Viet Nam. Now, I'm Teaching Assistant at Telecommunications Faculty I - PTIT.

🔬 My research interests are in Bioinformatics and Applying Machine Learning in solving real world problems.

📚 I'm currently looking opportunity for pursuing PhD in the field of Machine Learning in Europe.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and Computer Network.

# Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
During my time as a Research Assistant at the Data and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, I had the privilege of diving into a realm where the boundaries of knowledge blur, working on cutting-edge projects that harnessed the power of AI to tackle real-world challenges. Here are a few standout ventures that I had the pleasure of being part of:
- *Design A low-cost AI-based smart wearable device for supporting visually impaired people* (PI)

- *Smart IoT device for face recognition and temperature detection using thermal images based on Deep Learning, open-source IoT platforms, and mini-computer as edge devices.* (PI)
- *Pediatric Sepsis Diagnosis Based on Differential Gene Expression and Machine Learning method* (PI)
- *Efficient methodology for gene expression analysis based on Deep Learning for ALS disease* (PI)
- *A Novel Approach Based on Machine Learning for Revealing Potential Biomarkers to Diagnose Sepsis* (PI)
- *Deep reinforcement learning framework for routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment in Elastic Optical Network* (Key member)
- *Research and develop a smart system for health monitoring and abnormal detection based on electrocardiogram signal* (Key member)
- *Research and Improve Video Streaming Protocol by DASH protocol* granted by **Naver AI Research** (Key member)
- *Develop a face recognition and forehead temperature system for detecting fever symptoms based on Machine Learning techniques, edge devices, and IoT platforms* granted by **NAVER AI Research** (Key member)


## 👨🏻‍💻 Industry Experience
I had worked as Intern in two companies during my undergraduate. More detail below :D 

### Data Scientist Intern - PIXTA Vietnam
