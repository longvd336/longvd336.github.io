👨🏻‍💻 I have recently earned an Honors Engineering Degree in Electronics and Telecommunications from the Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT) in Hanoi, Vietnam. Currently, I am serving as a Lecturer Assistant at the Telecommunications Faculty I within PTIT.

🔬 My research interests include Machine Learning and Applying AI for dealing with sustainable development issue.

📚 I will be going to the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Fall 2024 to pursue a PhD degree in Data Science under the guidance of Professor. Hai Phan:D

📽️ I'm also keen to provide assistance to others on their journey in the fields of Machine Learning and Computer Networks.
