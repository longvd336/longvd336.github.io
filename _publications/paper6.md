collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper6
excerpt: "We explore the gene expression of the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - an rare disease that lacks of research nowadays, especially in Vietnam. An sequential of gene selection and gene ranking are considered as the effective procedure for identify signature biomarker realted to ALS. Besides, an powerful diagnosis model is constructed based on the selecte genes which perform overpower the current study of prediction ALS disease.(Under review)"
